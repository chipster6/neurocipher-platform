# Security Guide for AuditHound

## Quick Security Checklist

Before deploying AuditHound, ensure you've completed these security steps:

### üîë Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Replace ALL placeholder values with secure credentials
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Run `./scripts/validate-env.sh` to validate configuration

### üîê Password Requirements
- [ ] Database password: minimum 12 characters
- [ ] Secret keys: minimum 32 characters
- [ ] All passwords are randomly generated
- [ ] No default/example passwords remain

### üåê Network Security
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to your domains only
- [ ] No `localhost` in production CORS settings
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled in production

### üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] JWT secret keys are unique and secure
- [ ] Session timeouts configured appropriately
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication enabled
- [ ] Strong password policies enforced

## Environment Variable Security

### Required Variables
These must be set for production deployment:

```bash
# Database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<minimum-12-chars>

# Application Security
SECRET_KEY=<minimum-32-chars>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<minimum-32-chars>

# Admin Access
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=<minimum-8-chars>

# Network Security
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Generate Strong Passwords**
   ```bash
   # Generate secure passwords
   openssl rand -base64 32  # For SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY
   openssl rand -base64 16  # For passwords
   ```

2. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Run before deployment
   ./scripts/validate-env.sh
   ```

3. **Environment Separation**
   - Use different credentials for dev/staging/production
   - Never use production credentials in development
   - Store secrets in secure secret management systems

## Docker Security

### Container Security
- All services run as non-root users
- Containers use minimal base images
- Health checks configured for all services
- Resource limits should be configured

### Network Security
- Services communicate via internal Docker network
- Only necessary ports exposed to host
- Database and Redis not exposed to internet

### Volume Security
- Sensitive files mounted read-only where possible
- Logs directory has appropriate permissions
- Database volumes encrypted at rest (recommended)

## API Security

### Authentication
- JWT tokens used for authentication
- Tokens expire after reasonable time
- Refresh token mechanism implemented
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Input Validation
- All inputs validated using Pydantic models
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- XSS protection enabled
- CSRF protection implemented

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages to clients
- Detailed errors logged internally only
- No sensitive information in error responses

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts logged
- Unusual access patterns detected
- API rate limit violations tracked
- Database connection monitoring

### Audit Logging
- All user actions logged
- Configuration changes tracked
- Access to sensitive resources monitored
- Log integrity protection enabled

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Change all credentials
   - Review access logs
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Preserve evidence
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Assess damage scope
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for further issues

- Security Team: security@yourcompany.com
- Incident Response: incident@yourcompany.com
- Emergency: Use your organization's emergency procedures

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Personal data encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention policies implemented
- Right to deletion supported
- Data access controls enforced

### Regulatory Compliance
- SOC 2 controls implemented
- ISO 27001 alignment verified
- Regional compliance (GDPR, CCPA) addressed
- Regular compliance audits scheduled

## Security Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Security patches applied immediately
- [ ] Configuration reviewed quarterly
- [ ] Penetration testing annually

### Vulnerability Management
- [ ] Automated dependency scanning enabled
- [ ] Security alerts monitored
- [ ] Incident response plan tested
- [ ] Security training completed
